What is the expected behavior of auto scroll?

1. Once a card is clicked, it's locked, meaning it's y-position will not change. [done]

2. Any form of scrolling on the leftside will unlock any locked card.

3. deselecting the card also unlock the card (though deselecting shouldn't change a locked card position).

4. if the window size is changed and no card is locked, the "scroll percentage" will be maintained (i.e. if it was at the very top, it'll stay there, if it was at the very bottom, it'll stay there, if it's anything in between, it'll scroll accordingly). 


Now how do i go about implementing that?

Home needs to know its children's dimension and its own dimension, so that it can calculate how card will be wrapped.

it then needs to remember: which card is locked, and the position of the card that's locked.

Everytime it render, it'll check the position of the locked card, and the locked position, it'll then scroll any differences.

It'll need to rerender every time it resize, so that the scroll proporsion is maintained.

It'll need to be notified onscroll, so it can unlock card.



A custom wrap is no different than letting the stack wrap and caculate how did the stack wrap.


what does it need to do:

1. be rerendered when it's resized. It'll be resized in 2 ways, one is through window resizing, another one is through showcard detail changing,

For show card detail, Home Will be rerendered anyway so no need to report through context.

For window resizing, looks like I'll have to make a viewport. [done]

2. To be notified onscroll, luckily there's a html callback for this.

3. to be notified on lock, this will be accomplished through overriding showCardDetail+.

4. it'll check and remember the card's position through ref when needed.

sequence description:

1.
A card is clicked, card notify home through 3, home remember the card's id and it's position via 4.

2.
onScroll or card deselect happen, home will be notified via context

3.
home changes size, whenever that happens, home will rerender (viewport will make sure that happen).

4.
onscroll happen, home will record it's current scroll percentage.

5.
with it's current scroll percentage, or locked card position recorded, it will use useEffect to call scroll to scroll to the correct place everytime.



Need to investiage, does calling scroll trigger onscroll?

If it does, we need to tell the differences between onscroll so that home doesn't get notified when i call onscroll.

Homecontext need: override appcontext's showCardDetail [done] to lockCard [done]

Home need: currentLockedCard (nullable, with id and yPos) [done], scrollPercentage.

It'll use scrollHeight, scrolltop, clientHeight to calculate scrollPercentage.
