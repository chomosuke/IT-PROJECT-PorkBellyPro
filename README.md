# IT-PROJECT-PorkBellyProooo

We need to do some stuff:
decide on our workflow (i.e. all the pull request, branches and stuff, some of our member (such as me), needs to be briefed on how pull request work).
We'll decide on our tech stack once client give us the requirement.
After that we should also decide on different roles if people want to be in charge of one single thing.
